# 🗺️ StackFoundry Roadmap
🚀 **Forge Your Future in Tech** with a structured learning path from **Python basics → AI & Freelancing**  

This roadmap is designed to guide learners through:  
1. 🐍 **Core Python** (PCAP prep, syntax, OOP, modules)  
2. 📊 **Data & Algorithms** (collections, files, problem solving)  
3. 🔢 **Math Foundations** (statistics, linear algebra, probability)  
4. 🤖 **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, projects, portfolio building)  
5. 🧠 **Deep Learning** (PyTorch/TensorFlow, projects, optimizations)  
6. 💬 **AI Agents & LLMs** (LangChain, RAG, custom models)  
7. ☁️ **Cloud & MLOps** (AWS, CI/CD, deployment pipelines)  
8. 💼 **Freelancing Skills** (portfolio, client projects, pricing, soft skills)
